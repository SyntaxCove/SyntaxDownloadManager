# Worklog — UniDM (Unified Browser + Advanced Download Manager)

Shared multi-agent work log. Append-only. Product: production-grade Windows 11 x64 desktop app
(Electron shell + React/Fluent renderer + Rust `download-core` supervised subprocess).
Engineering priority: data integrity > security > reliability/recovery > correctness >
maintainability > performance > UX > feature breadth. No AI features. No placeholders/mocks/TODOs
in deliverable code.

Task ID: 0
Agent: main
Task: Sandbox recovery + Phase 0 (monorepo scaffold, conventions, authoritative phase map)

Work Log:
- Found sandbox reset: repo contained only "Initial commit" (.env/.gitignore). Phases 0–4 from the
  prior session were not persisted. Per user protocol ("فاز N" = deliver through Phase N), rebuilt
  everything through Phase 5 in this session.
- Verified toolchain: Node v24.21.0, npm 11.19.0, Rust 1.99.0 (rustup installed), gcc 14.2,
  npm registry reachable.
- Pinned versions from registry (not memory): electron 44.5.1, @fluentui/react-components 9.74.9,
  react 19.3.0, zustand 5.0.15, zod 4.6.5, vite 8.3.3, @vitejs/plugin-react 6.1.2,
  typescript 5.9.3 (TS7 rejected as too new for toolchain), vitest 5.0.3.
- Policy: sandbox installs Electron with ELECTRON_SKIP_BINARY_DOWNLOAD=1 (no GUI in Linux sandbox;
  user's Windows machine performs full install + GUI verification + .exe packaging).
- Wrote docs/PHASES.md (authoritative 0–31 phase map), docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, root scaffold,
  tsconfig.base.json, workspaces layout, .gitignore, scripts/.

Stage Summary:
- Repo layout established: packages/contracts, apps/desktop (main/preload/renderer),
  core/ (Rust workspace: dc-protocol, dc-storage, download-core), docs/, scripts/.
- Next: Phase 1 contracts package.

Task ID: 0-5 (rebuild)
Agent: main
Task: Deliver Phases 0→5 for "فاز ۵" (sandbox reset recovery)

Work Log:
- Rebuilt Phases 0–4 from scratch (commits 60801e6, 1d95ed1, 0d53b2e, e35fbd6, 98abf40).
- Phase 5: Rust workspace (dc-protocol/dc-storage/download-core), 25 cargo tests incl.
  cross-language fixtures + engine integration with local HTTP server + spawned-binary e2e;
  TS CoreSupervisor/CoreClient/backoff + download domain + Downloads UI (42 desktop tests).
- Full verify: typecheck ✓, vitest 54 ✓, cargo fmt/clippy ✓, cargo test 25 ✓, vite build ✓.

Stage Summary:
- Through Phase 5, the app has: sandboxed Electron shell, validated typed IPC, React+Fluent
  UI with theme/settings, WebContentsView browser tabs, and a supervised resumable download
  engine with SQLite persistence. Next: Phase 6 (segmented engine) per docs/PHASES.md.
